# Introduction :<br>
Voice assistants are devices/apps that use voice recognition technology,<br> natural language processing, and AI to respond to humans.
Using the technology, the device synthesises the user's message, breaks it down, evaluates it, and offers a meaningful response in return.

# Libraries used in the project :<br>
- pyttsx3 2.90 <br>
- wikipedia 1.4.0 <br>
- datetime <br>
- smtplib <br>
- webbrowser <br>
- SpeechRecognition 3.8.1<br>

# Commands used to install required libraries :
- pip install pyttsx3
- pip install wikipedia
- pip install webbroser
- pip install smtplib
- pip install SpeechRecognition

# Used Libraries Information :
1. pyttsx3 (version 2.90) : <br> pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
<br><br>
2. wikipedia (version 1.4.0) : <br> Wikipedia is a Python library that makes it easy to access and parse data from Wikipedia.Search Wikipedia, get article summaries, get data like links and images from a page, and more. Wikipedia wraps the MediaWiki API so you can focus on using Wikipedia data, not getting it.
<br><br>
3. datetime : The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times. While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation.
<br><br>
4. smtplib : The smtplib module defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon. For details of SMTP and ESMTP operation, consult RFC 821 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and RFC 1869 (SMTP Service Extensions).
<br><br>
5. webbrowser : The webbrowser module provides a high-level interface to allow displaying web-based documents to users. Under most circumstances, simply calling the open() function from this module will do the right thing.
<br><br>
6. SpeechRecognition (version 3.8.1) : Python library to connect to several speech recognition APIs, including CMU Sphinx, Google Cloud, Wit.ai, … . It can be used for stream processing (in “real-time” with automatic detection of end according to the API) or for batch processing, both with synchronous speech recognition (response as soon as it is processed) for short audio sequences and asynchronous speech recognition (for larger files).

# Functionalities :
- Sending E-mail
- Searching information on wikipedia
- Open particular software installed on the system
- Play music available on system.
